# FancyComposePetFinder

An Android app built with Jetpack Compose that fetches random pet data from a network API using Retrofit. It displays the pets in a scrollable list, and tapping on any item shows a dialog with detailed information.

---

## Features

- **Jetpack Compose** for building the UI (lists, cards, dialogs, etc.).
- **MVVM Architecture**: Organized into ViewModel, Repository, and Data layers for clarity and maintainability.
- **Retrofit + OkHttp** for network requests and data parsing.
- **Coroutines & StateFlow**: Asynchronous data loading in the ViewModel, and reactive UI updates via StateFlow.
- **Coil**: Efficient loading and displaying of images from the internet.
- **Rotation Persistence**: Uses `rememberSaveable` (or ViewModel state) so data isnâ€™t lost when rotating the screen.
- **Detail Dialog**: Tapping on any pet card opens a dialog with additional details such as pet ID and dimensions.
